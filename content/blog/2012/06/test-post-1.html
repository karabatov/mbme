I want to use my fifteen minutes of fame on The Listserve to rant about
something that's close to my heart: the stability of the software I use.

NOTE: This is written for people who create software.  If you don't do that you
probably won't find this very interesting.  Sorry!  Maybe you could read Text
from Dog if you haven't seen it already?  Either way, have a nice
morning/afternoon/evening!

The Situation
-------------

Every time I get a new computer, I go through the same song and dance:

1. Look at what programs and packages I have installed on the old computer.
2. Install these programs on the new computer.
3. Copy over my configuration files from the old computer to the new one.
4. Spend the rest of my day fixing all the things that broke because I'm using
   a newer version of program X.

Step 4 is always the most painful part of getting a new machine.  Always.

Without fail I spend several hours tweaking configuration files, adjusting my
workflow, and so on because I've upgraded to a new version of foo which doesn't
support option X any more or requires library Y version N+1 now.

Getting a new computer should be a *pleasant* experience!  The unboxing from the
sleek packaging, that "new laptop" smell, the nostalgia of the default desktop
image.  Why does this horrible step 4 have to exist and how can we get rid of
it?
